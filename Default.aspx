            We provide you one stop place for all the policy and claim settlements.
            Health Plus optimize your critical policy and claim settlements in a well versed way.
            Insurance is a method of sharing the unexpected financial losses of an 
            ‘unfortunate few’ from a common fund formed out of contributions of the ‘many’, 
            who are equally exposed to the same loss. Health Insurance pays for unexpected 
            Hospitalisation expenses of those few insured persons who suffer from illness or 
            injury requiring treatment as inpatient in a Hospital/Nursing Home, out of 
            contributions of many insured persons who are exposed to similar 
            health risks. We provide you with the best class policy and claim settlements in a simplified approach.
